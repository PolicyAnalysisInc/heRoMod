## Introduction

The objective of value-based pricing (VBP) is to determine the maximum price at which a health technology is cost-effective at a specific willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold. A price parameter value is evaluated between upper and lower bounds, and the results are reported. VBP assumes a linear relationship between the price of the health technology and the cost of the strategy. 

## Define the analysis

This example uses the three-strategy model defined in the article "Markov Models for Health Economic Evaluation: The R Package heRomod". See this article for an explanation of the model. Note that as in DSA and PSA, parameters need to be defined in `define_parameters()` in order to be modified in a VBP.

In this example we will compute the VBP of 1 price parameter:

  * `cost_med`, the price associated with the medicine.

Upper and lower values for the price parameter are given to `define_vbp()`.

```{r}
def_vbp <- define_vbp(
  cost_med, 0, 1000
)
```

We then run the value-based pricing analysis with `run_dsa()`, using `res_mod` the result from `run_model()` as input, defining the strategy affected by the health technology of interest and a range of WTP thresholds.

```{r, message=F}
res_vbp <- run_vbp(model = res_mod, 
                   vbp = def_vbp,
                   strategy_vbp = "med",
                   wtp_thresholds = c(0, 10000))
```

## Interpretation

The basic plot (`bw = "FALSE"`) displays the difference in costs between the selected strategy and the other comparison strategies as a linear function of the price defined in `def_vbp()`. The VBP is determined by the lowest price at each WTP. The black line displays the VBP (i.e., the price at which the health technology is cost-effective) by WTP threshold.

For this example, `cost_med` has a positive linear effect on the difference of costs between `med` and `base` and `surg`. The VBP of `cost_med` changes slope at a WTP threshold of 4,800 approx., which is where the two differences of costs between `med` and `base` and `surg` intersect.

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.align='center'}
plot(res_vbp)
```
