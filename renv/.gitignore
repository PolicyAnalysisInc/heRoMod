# This file ensures the renv directory is tracked by Git.
# It should be empty or contain rules for files within renv/
# that should NOT be ignored if a broader rule (e.g. in top-level .gitignore)
# would otherwise ignore them.
# For renv, typically activate.R and settings.dcf should be tracked.
!activate.R
!settings.dcf
