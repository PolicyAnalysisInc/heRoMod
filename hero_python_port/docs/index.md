# Welcome to `hero_py`!

`hero_py` is a Python library for health economic modeling, providing tools to build, simulate, and analyze models like cohort-based Markov models, Partitioned Survival Models (PSMs), and conduct sensitivity analyses (PSA, DSA), value of information analyses (EVPI/EVPPI), model calibration and scenario analysis.

This project is a Python port inspired by the R package `heRomod` and aims to bring similar robust functionalities to the Python ecosystem.

**Current Status:** Alpha - Under Active Development. The API is evolving.
